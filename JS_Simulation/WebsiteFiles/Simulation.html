						This simulation is designed to test the concept of a novel adaptive control based on changing Degrees of Freedom (DoF).
						The presented scenario is of a red robot manipulator attempting to grasp blue boxes one at a time and transporting 
						them to the proximitiy of the red target circle.
						The manipulator can close its black fingers to apply force on a box and hold it during manipulation.<br>
						Possible variation: The boxes can have poles, which are connected to one side of them. This creates a situation where the robot
						can only grasp the boxes from a defined side (the one opposite of the pole) and make the scenario much more complicated to control.
					</p>
					<p>
						The standard control allows the user to control the robots 4 DoF (forwards, sideways, rotation, grasping) individually.<br>
						The adaptive control uses a neural network to assess the current state and offer specialised DoFs for control. 
						This results in enabling the user to control the robot using changing DoFs. 
						The DoFs are represented in the Head-Up-Disply (HUD): numerically in the left corner and as arrows drawn onto the gripper.<br>						
						The numerical representation also includes the networks assumptions of probabilities for each DoF in the fifth row.
						Up to two Adaptive DoFs can be selected, with the darker colored one being named <em>Adaptive DoF #1</em> for control.<br>
						Press <em>Show Controls</em> to see an overview of the input keys.
					</p>
					<p>
						This website can be used to generate training data. <br>
						To do this, best disable the adaptive control option and initially get used to the standard controls.<br>
						Once you are familiar with the standard control, press <em>Start Recording</em> and run the scenario to the best of your abilities.<br>
						By pressing <em>Restart</em>, a new scenario will be loaded. It is possible to restart multiple times during a recording; the attempts will all be logged.
						If finished with data aquisition, press <em>Stop Recording</em>. A prompt box will open asking you for a comment on your recording. 
						Please provide a slim description of what you have done, including listing any problems you encountered.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following dropdown lists allow choices of different experiences of adaptive control, including the underlying model of the neural network
						and different control settings. Feel free to explore your favorites.
