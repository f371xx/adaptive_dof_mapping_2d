## Scripts for Learning
**Create2DModel.ipynb** combines everything to build and train the 2D model.

**custom_layers.py** provides multiple custom layers used by the neural network models.

**Dataset2d.ipynb** handles loading and preprocessing of datasets. Also provides functions to display results

**MomentMetrics.ipynb** provides metrics and loss functions using covariance matrices and main moments.

The folder (**model**) can be created as a temporal storage for the 2D model before copying them to the [namedModels](/JS_Simulation/namedModels) folder
